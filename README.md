# SurfacePro1-DSDT
Patched DSDT for the first version of Microsoft Surface Pro

With hope for a better maintainable DSDT, this repository builds on the original DSDT file (extracted from the device), documenting all the applied changes.

## Installation
Download the latest dsdt.aml from [releases](https://github.com/myr1/SurfacePro1-DSDT/releases) (or build it from the .asl yourself e.g. with [MaciASL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/maciasl/)), save it to EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched folder on your EFI partition.

## More info
Credit goes to the authors of the original patches and all the guys from insanelymac.com who found them, applied them and tested them!
