# SurfacePro1-DSDT
Patched DSDT for the first version of Microsoft Surface Pro

With hope for a better maintainable DSDT, this repository builds on the original DSDT file (extracted from the device), documenting all the applied changes.

Credit goes to the authors of the original patches and all the guys from insanelymac.com who found them, applied them and tested them!
